# The WiFi ID Card
Welcome to my adventures in placing my WiFi info, on an ID card (ID-1 Format, 85.6 x 53.98 mm or 3.370 x 2.125 inches).

## Why the need for this project

Picture this: you invite some friends at your place, or family, and they get tired of dealing with you or just want to have some internet time away from the kids (that are destroying your house) and the question arrives "can I connect to the WiFi?". At this point you open a drawer, look frenetically for the original piece of paper from the cable company, and then you remember that you saw your kids playing with that exact same piece of paper some days ago, it is now gone. “Fine”, you say, “I know it by heart, the SSID is (insert generic cable company SSID here) and the password is (m4573r_h4x0r)”.
This is quite common, I don’t have a data plan so, every time I want to show or do something on the internet while away, this is the kind of thing that happens. But recently, I’ve noticed a QR Code icon on my phone and it lead me to wonder, how do this work, and, more important, how can I use it. There are alternatives, like WPS, but my kids are always touching that big button so I disabled that feature on the router (yes I know that sometimes it doesn't work, but a recent firmware release took care of exacly that).

## How it will be done

### The Format

The idea is to generate an ID card size document with the WiFi information in both text and on a QR Code (the WPS Pin can also be included).
The ID-1 Card Format has the following dimentions (ISO/IEC 7810) [^ISO7810]:
[^ISO7810]: https://www.iso.org/standard/70483.html

| Dimentions (mm) | Dimentions (inch) |
| --------------- | ----------------- |
| 85.6 x 53.98    | 3.370 × 2.125     |

This format size was chosen since it can be placed on those ID card holders and then glued on the router. Yes I know that my kids might play with it also, but I can either print a new one, or show a pdf version that I will keep on my phone.
