# The WiFi Business Card
Welcome to my adventures in placing my WiFi info, on a business card.

## Why the need for this project

Picture this: you invite some friends at your place, or family, and they get tired of dealing with you or just want to have some internet time away from the kids (that are destroying your house) and the question arrives "can I connect to the WiFi?". At this point you open a drawer, look frenetically for the original piece of paper from the cable company, and then you remember that you saw your kids playing with that exact same piece of paper some days ago, it is now gone. “Fine”, you say, “I know it by heart, the SSID is [insert generic cable company SSID here] and the password is [m4573r_h4x0r]”.
This is quite common, I don’t have a data plan so, every time I want to show or do something on the internet while away, this is the kind of thing that happens. But recently, I’ve noticed a QR Code icon on my phone and it lead me to wonder, how do this work, and, more important, how can I use it. There are alternatives, like WPS, but my kids are always touching that big button so I disabled that feature on the router.

## How it will be done

The idea is to generate a business card size document with the WiFi information in both text and on a QR Code (the WPS Pin can also be included). The reason for this business card size
